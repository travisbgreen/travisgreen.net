Hey! I'm a senior cybersecurity professional with 20+ years of experience that includes extensive international work advising government and military clients, consulting to enterprise businesses on security strategy, mentoring teams in best practices, and leading execution of security initiatives. I currently serve as a Head of Research at DuskRise, a global enterprise edge security provider.

I began my technology career at Microsoft and was later an early employee for online gaming pioneer WildTangent as an engineer in their data center.
