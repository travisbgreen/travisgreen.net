Who is this Travis guy?

I'm a senior cybersecurity professional with 20+ years of experience that includes international work advising government and military clients, consulting to enterprise businesses on security strategy, mentoring teams in best practices, and leading execution of security initiatives. I ~~currently~~ formerly serve as a Head of Research at DuskRise, a global enterprise edge security provider.

I hold multiple certifications including CISSP, Certified Ethical Hacker, and SANS GCIA certifications. I was a core team member of the Open Information Security Foundation where I was responsible for training and has delivering presentations at conferences, most recently at SuriCon 2017 in Prague. I am also a former CyberPatriot Mentor where I taught cyber ethics and defense skills to troubled youth.

I currently reside in Denver and am enjoying the endless outdoor recreation possibilities the area provides.
