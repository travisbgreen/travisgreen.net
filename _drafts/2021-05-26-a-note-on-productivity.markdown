I've been working at the computer for 40 hours a week for most of my adult life (22ish years), and I've found focus and concentratioon harder to come by.

Outline:
- background, focus used to be easier, now it's harder
- a person can be very unfocused without even realizing it
- advances in tech caused this issue, advances in tech can solve it
- rescue time and productivity journaling
- monotasking per workspace
